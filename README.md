# Unstructured Data Analytics

This repository hosts code and resources for analysing unstructured data â€” including **text, image, audio, and video** â€” using machine learning techniques. It is designed to support businesses and academic researchers, analysts, and students interested in exploring unstructured data across business, social science, and interdisciplinary domains.

The aim is to provide practical, adaptable scripts in **R and Python** that demonstrate how to transform unstructured content into meaningful insights. Whether you're working with customer reviews, product images, executive speeches, or video content, unstructured data offers a rich (but often untapped) source of information.

This project is a companion to the LinkedIn newsletter *Unstructured Data Analytics*, and serves as a workspace for examples, experiments, and evolving tools. As such, this repository will grow over time and may include:

- **Text analysis**: topic modelling, classification, sentimant analysis
- **Image analysis**: classification, object detection, emotional analysis
- **Audio analysis**: sentimant analysis
- **Video analysis**: emotional analysis, object detection
- Supporting code for preprocessing, visualisation, and evaluation
